Visualize the source code of your entire project.\
Zoom out to get the rough structure, zoom in as deep as you want to get the details at an appropriate level.\
Customize the visualization and share your imagination through Git.\
Mammutmap visualizes source code in an UML-like diagram that updates with code changes.\
Mammutmap scales extremely well and can handle huge projects.

This is an early version but I am working frequently on improving it.

Also as Mammutmap is written in TypeScript it is very simple to write plugins for it.

Navigation works with scroll wheel, double click or selecting folders in explorer:\

Generating links works manually (right click) or with a link generation plugin (also accessible via right click):\
